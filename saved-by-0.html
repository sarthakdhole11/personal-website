    <p>
      This is not intended to be a philosophical paper, although the question of whether it is one
      is philosophical in itself. It is an expanded view into an idea I have been engaging with for
      about a year now, across conversations in very different spheres of life.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Maybe someday, saved by zero, I’ll be more together; stretched by fewer thoughts that leave me chasing…
      <cite>
        The Fixx, <em>Saved by Zero</em>; Bauman, <em>Liquid Modernity</em> (2000)
      </cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Zygmunt Bauman’s assertion that freedom cannot be gained against society seems, at first glance,
      almost Machiavellian. However, Bauman is not offering advice to rulers but reflecting on the
      structure of the self within modern social conditions. He is diagnosing, not prescribing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Liberation, in Bauman’s sense, does not mean the absence of constraint. It means the ability to
      act meaningfully within a world of shared expectations, institutions, and language. Outside of
      that framework, autonomy becomes performative rather than productive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rousseau’s social contract offers a useful parallel. In exchanging natural liberty for civil
      liberty, individuals accept constraint in order to gain stability, predictability, and mutual
      recognition. Absolute freedom in the state of nature does not translate into practical agency.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kant sharpens this distinction further. For him, freedom is not acting on impulse but acting in
      accordance with laws one rationally endorses. Social norms can embody these laws, but only when
      they withstand ethical scrutiny. Submission without examination is not freedom.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sartre would object here. Roles, norms, expectations — all are forms of bad faith. Yet radical
      autonomy without shared structures collapses into isolation. Choice requires context; language
      requires community; meaning requires continuity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Adler’s emphasis on horizontal relationships points toward a social freedom grounded in
      cooperation rather than domination. One can belong without being absorbed, participate without
      being erased.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bauman, then, is not arguing for obedience. He is arguing for embeddedness. Freedom is not found
      in flight from society, but in shaping it, contesting it, and negotiating one’s place within it.
    </p>

    <p>
      In that sense, the aphorism matters. It is brief, repeatable, mobile. It survives in unstable
      contexts. It does not explain everything, but it holds long enough to orient thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      Maybe that is what being saved by zero means — not escaping the system, but resetting within it,
      momentarily, before re-entering with fewer illusions of purity.
    </p>
