        <p>On a Personal Science</p>

<blockquote>
    “And so I thought that since the sciences contained in books—at least those based upon merely probable reasoning and not on demonstrations—are put together and amassed little by little from the opinions of many different persons, they never get as close to the truth as the simple reasonings that a man of good sense can naturally make concerning whatever he comes across.”
    <cite>René Descartes, <em>Discourse on the Method</em> (1637)</cite>

Well, it’s the Idols of the Cave and the Wisdom of the Crowds, right? What does that tell us? It’s not the other way around, for one. People tend to believe that the many are smarter than the few—entire books have been written about it. On the other hand, the notion of an individual investigator has always been vulnerable to criticism, and the very idea of building from scratch without reliance on established terminology, thinkers, and thought has been set up for ridicule. Sir Francis Bacon noted the biases of individuals (<em>idola specus</em>) in his <em>Idols of the Mind</em>, warning against the false images born of one’s personal cave—one’s own limited experience and bias. Yet René Descartes, writing not even more than a couple of decades after Bacon, takes the other side: he places his trust not in the accumulated judgments of many, but in the “simple reasonings that a man of good sense can naturally make.”
</p>

<p>
On 10 November 1619, detained in a village in Germany, Descartes had an illuminating day of solitary reflection in a small stove-heated room. So illuminating, in fact, that he later described solitary reflection as the ideal way of seeking truth. In <em>Discourse on the Method</em>, he writes that the sciences contained in books, “amassed little by little from the opinions of many,” never reach as close to the truth as “the simple reasonings that a man of good sense can naturally make.” One can visualize this if one thinks of how buildings undertaken and completed by a single architect are usually better planned and more attractive than those patched together by many, repurposing old walls built for different purposes. Similarly, one person’s reasoning alone reaches closer to the truth than a multitude layering their opinions. This is precisely what Descartes is trying to capture through this quote.
</p>

<p>
I agree with Descartes’ conclusion that individual reason is more capable of closing in on the truth than the reason of the scientific community, taken as a whole. I am, however, not fully satisfied with the argument Descartes originally proposes, and I aim to complement it with a more robust argument from the philosophy of language. Descartes blames the vanity of crowds; I blame the medium that connects them. I argue that the true obstacle to scientific truth is not the corruption of human will, but the indeterminacy of language—the very bridge on which collective inquiry must travel. I will also show how Descartes himself seems conflicted in his texts about how to deal with the implications of this position. I will then discuss the practical limitations of a purely individual investigation through insights from phenomenology, while still giving credit to the sciences for their ability to address deeper questions systematically.
</p>

<p>
First, let us enter Descartes’ mind on that freezing November day and identify the assumptions underlying his argument:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Everyone, even those who desire excess in most things, does not usually desire more of “good sense,” the capacity to distinguish true from false.</li>
    <li>It is unlikely that everyone is mistaken.</li>
    <li>Good sense must therefore be naturally equal among all people.</li>
    <li>People differ not in intellect, but in how they direct it—this alone explains the diversity of opinions.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>a.</strong> When examined philosophically, most human undertakings are vain and misguided.<br>
        <strong>b.</strong> Humanity, as a collective, directs its thinking toward comfort, custom, and reputation rather than truth.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
This, for Descartes, explains why collective knowledge is inferior: it inherits confusion. The individual investigator begins anew, free from inherited error. Yet this argument falters. Descartes suddenly trusts the judgment of the masses in premise (ii.), despite criticizing it in his conclusion. His skepticism toward collective judgment appears volatile. Early in the <em>Discourse</em>, he invites public judgment of his method as feedback. Why would he value public opinion if he believed collective thought to be vain and useless?
</p>

<p>
Descartes’ criticism identifies only the surface of the problem. What he calls the “opinions of many” are unstable not merely because they are vain, but because they depend on words. The quote frames two distinct kinds of knowledge-seeking endeavors. I call them collective KSEs and personal KSEs, distinguished by their reliance on dialogue and language.
</p>

<p>
Collective KSEs—science in particular—require language. And language, though connective, bends what it carries. Bacon had already warned us in his <em>Idols of the Marketplace</em> that words “obstruct the understanding.” Every scientific term—“energy,” “species,” “consciousness”—undergoes quiet metamorphoses as it moves across disciplines, time, and minds. Meaning slides. Jean-Jacques Lacan famously noted that the signifier constantly slips beneath the signified. Communication itself alters what is communicated.
</p>

<p>
Imagine a cognitive scientist, a neuroscientist, and a psychoanalyst debating the nature of “mind.” Even within the same discipline, separated by decades, agreement dissolves. As Michael Polanyi observes, language-users commit themselves to indeterminacy because they rely on formal structures whose meanings demand constant reinterpretation.
</p>

<p>
Thus, if collective inquiry drifts from truth, it is not because it is morally corrupt, but because truth loses clarity with every linguistic hand it passes through. In this sense, the individual’s reasoning is closer to truth not because it is purer, but because it is epistemically simpler.
</p>

<p>
Personal KSEs do not require dialogue—but that does not mean they are language-free. Even solitary study relies on inherited terms and conceptual frameworks. No word exists in isolation, and thus no inquiry truly does either.
</p>

<p>
Phenomenology offers a partial escape. Through <em>epoché</em>, one brackets presuppositions and attends to lived experience without categorization. Here, language recedes. Observation precedes description. Indeterminacy diminishes.
</p>

<p>
Yet this path is limited. Very little knowledge can be shared or operationalized without language. This is where science deserves credit. Collective inquiry trades certainty for corrigibility. A thousand imperfect descriptions may converge on a clearer map. The collective may never grasp truth in its fullness, but it expands the range of questions we can ask.
</p>

<p>
The crowd builds cathedrals of knowledge, stone upon stone, word upon word. The individual sketches quietly on untouched ground. Descartes may have been wrong about why solitude brings us closer to truth, but right that it does. And yet, without the language of others, that truth remains unspoken, unseen, and unused.
